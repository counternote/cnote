Counternote is a chromatic musical language meant to be typed and sung. It is a work in progress so there may be errors.

Counternote is an answer to a question that a lot of people have asked despite a solid solution already existing — namely, is there a [Markdown][md] for music, by which they mean a human readable plaintext music notation? The answer is yes: it’s called [ABC notation][abc], and it’s great. If that’s all you are looking for, you do not need to read more. Go support it!

However, ABC notation is not a music notation directly. It’s a music notation *notation* with another layer of translation (music —> staff —> ABC). Counternote is a different kind of abstraction from western music notation, a linguistic one, not a visual one, so it can be written in plaintext directly (music —> Counternote).

Counternote has been created as a complementary foil to the venerable staff notation, not a replacement. Even the most seasoned of musicians is likely to gain another perspective on music by learning it.

But this is not a one way street. Counternote is not yet set in stone and is still being tweaked, so any relevant feedback or constructive criticism will be considered and appreciated. You can join the [Discord][dc] and suggest away.
