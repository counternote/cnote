# Quick Start

Counternote can be thought of as a musical language, but do not let that idea trouble you. The way to learn Counternote is by practicing music, and practicing Counternote will help you learn music. If you are reading this, you are probably motivated to do one of those things.

## Sounds

Sounds in Counternote come in three varieties — those where pitch is the defining characteristic, *tones* and *spans*, and those where pitch is indeterminable or incidental, *raps*.

### Tones

First up to practice are the twelve *tones*. These refer to absolute pitch, each named uniquely. They’re kind of like the letter names, but more precise. Starting from a traditional E and ending on D♯/E♭, we have:

    ——————————————————————————————————————————————————
      E   F   F♯  G   G♯  A   A♯  B   C   C♯  D   D♯
      wa  ga  ka  ya  xa  ja  ca  za  da  fa  ba  pa
    ——————————————————————————————————————————————————

You’ll notice `ka` and `ca` and maybe `za` and `xa` seem like they might sound the same, but they don’t — `c` is a 'ch' sound and `x` is a 'sh' sound in Counternote, always.

With those two tweaks in mind, speak each tone aloud paying attention to where your tongue touches (or comes close to touching) the roof of your mouth all the way until `fa`, `ba`, and `pa` where you need to think about your lips. Now say `wa` again, this time thinking about your lips.

The tones in Counternote are ordered by points of articulation — which is just a fancy way of saying where the sound of a consonant is coming from — and come back around with `wa` which has two points of articulation: the lips and the back of the tongue. 

Now you are ready pick up a guitar or sit at a piano (or open a music app on your phone, anything that does not use your mouth) and in a range that is somewhat comfortable for your voice, play each note and sing the tone by its name. If you don’t yet know where the traditional notes are — look them up, it’s great practice. Try it singing the tones chromatically, then try just the naturals (white keys on the piano) or just the accidentals (black keys on the piano), maybe some major scales starting at different roots, some triads, whatever you like. Give it ten minutes at least, but no more than twenty.

### Starts and Rhymes

Maybe you’ll have noticed during that first exercise that while all of those tones start with different consonants, they all rhyme with `-a`. So that’s what it’s called, a *rhyme*. Might as well call the start of the tones the *start* while we are being Captain Obvious.

The tone starts tell you the “pitch class” which is music jargon for all the notes that we label a letter, like C. Not just middle C but any and all C. In Counternote, this is the *rank* of a sound.

The tone rhyme, on the other hand, tells which specific octave a note is in. For `-a`, it could be any octave, but more specifically it’s the center octave. `da` is likely to be middle C. `-e` will be an octave up from there; `-o`, an octave down. In Counternote, this is the *file* of a sound.

Tone starts and rhymes go rank and file.

There are eleven rhymes for eleven files but we only really care about seven:

    —————————————————————————————————
      RHYME  FILE  IPA  ENGLISH-ISH
    —————————————————————————————————
       -l     +3    ɛl     'el'
       -i     +2    i      'ee'
       -e     +1    e      'eh'
       -a      0    ɑ      'ah'
       -o     -1    o      'oh'
       -u     -2    u      'oo'
       -r     -3    ɚ      'er'
    —————————————————————————————————

In the key of `ja`, the note directly below `wa` is `po` and directly above `pa` is `we`. This is called the *break*. If we place the tones around a clockface with the key center at 12, the break is bewteen 6 and 7:

    ——————————————————————————————————————————
                        12
              11        ja         1
                 xa  ===||===  ca
         10             ||              2
            ya  ========||========  za
                        ||
                        ||
      9   ka  ==========||==========  da   3
                        ||
                        ||
            ga  ========||========  fa
         8              ||              4
                 wa  ===||===  ba
              7         pa         5
             BREAK ↑    6
    ——————————————————————————————————————————

Now this may seem somewhat arbitrary — why not just always have the break between `wa` and `pa`? First of all, the break is informative, giving some sense of the range of a piece. But most importantly, it makes the tones and spans symmetrical.

Before we get to those spans, try taking out a piece of paper and drawing clockfaces, but instead of writing the numbers, place the tones in chromatic order. (It’s okay if you are really bad at drawing circles — you can always trace a glass — but it is important to place the tones right, so here’s a tip: put a mark at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions — north, east, south, west — and then put every third tone at those marks as you write them around the circle.)

Hopefully that wasn’t so tedious that you never want to look at a clockface again, because this next section might just go all-in on clocks.

### Spans

While tones let us talk about pitch in an absolute way, spans let us talk about pitch in a relative way. Musicians train their relative pitch sensibilities more than anything else — the basis of which is interval training. A span is just the Counternote term for interval.

Instead of the academic names of minor third and major sixth, spans give a sense of interval by vowel quality. `ho` 'hoe' (but without an ending 'w' sound) and `hm` 'home' are a minor third (♭3, m3) and a major sixth (6, M6). Notice that they share the same vowel 'oh'. That’s because a major sixth is the mirror version of a minor third and vice versa. A major sixth up is the same as a minor third down. A minor third up is the same as a major sixth down.

A great way of seeing these relationships is on the hue clock with intervals labeled in chromatic order (presented here with the “English-ish” pronunciation along the sides):

                    BREAK ↑  ♯4/♭5
    ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

We see the *break* is in the same place that the one for tones was:

    ——————————————————————————————————————————
                         12
              11        ha/ja        1

                         ||

              BREAK ↑    6
    ——————————————————————————————————————————

Notice that the span start is always `h-` and the tone rhyme is always `-a`. That’s because spans starts and rhymes go *file then rank*, the opposite of the tones.

We can see all the spans starts here:

    ————————————————————
      START  FILE  IPA

        s-    -2    s
        n-    -3    n
    ————————————————————

And the rhymes contain more than meets the eye — you can think of them as abbreviations, you know, for brevity’s sake:

    ——————————————————————————————————

Now it’s time to practice. Using the same instrument you used before, play the key center and then sing the interval up to an octave above as shown on this clock:

                             ♯4/♭5

Do this for no more than ten minutes, maybe changing the key center to get a feel for the relative nature of spans. Then repeat for the interval up to an octave below:

### Absolutely Relative

Now is a good time to address the elephant in the room: Why there are two ways of talking about musical pitch?

There is an inherent tension between absolute frequency like A440 and relative frequency like the 3:2 ratio of a perfect fifth. The first is more about physics and less about music. The second, though, is what music is based on, particularly the 3:2 ratio of most western music. In a very real sense, relative pitch is closer to the musical metal.

This distinction is so important that there are no less than four ways of conveying relative pitch in standard western notation, none of which are standard:

* as intervals like *m3* and *M6*
* as scale degrees like *♭3* and *6*
* as movable-do Solfège like *me* or *ma* and *la*
* as integer notation *3* and *9*

Each of those has problems, chief among them is that the only one that doesn’t use numbers is readily confused with a fixed-do Solfège used in half the world.

By representing pitch in these two different ways up front, Counternote can unambiguously handle stops and chords and *transposing instruments* without muddying the absolute pitch meaning of the tones.

If you play one of these transposing instruments, you may want to spend some extra time learning these spans. Tones should never be used with transposing instruments — it’s as close to *wrong* as Counternote allows. Instead, B♭ instruments should use spans centered on B♭, A instruments should use spans centered on A, and so on. The guitar can also act as a transposing instrument when tuned to a different standard such as E♭ or D, or when capoed up. A is the key center for E-standard tuning.

### Raps

The last kind of sound in Counternote is whatever doesn’t fit in the tones/spans. These include noise, drums, non-standard ways of producing sound on an instrument, and even memes.

Compared to tones and spans, raps are easier to demonstrate because they’re just a list of mostly user-defined sounds. They are also harder to learn because thy’re just a list of mostly user-defined sounds. There are two basic rules for creating raps, only the first of which must be followed:

* they cannot overlap with tones, spans, or reserved raps
* they should sound like what they stand for

These are some proposed raps, only the first three of which cannot be defined on a piece by piece basis:

    ————————————————————————

## Notes

Notes in Counternote refer specifically to sounds held for some duration. That duration is denoted by a *hold*.

### Holds

Holds are basic punctuation characters that are roughly equal to a whole note to a thirty-second note that must come immediately after the sound they hold out. These can be extended by trailing holds in the same bar or by adding the rap `aa` with a new hold at the beginning of the next bar.

The six holds ordered by powers of two are as follows:

    ———————————————————————————
      HOLD  VALUE  WORD   IPA
    ———————————————————————————
      `;`    1/32   qi    kʷi
      `:`    1/16   qe    kʷe
      `,`    1/8    qa    kʷɑ
      `.`    1/4    qo    kʷo
      `-`    1/2    qu    kʷu
      `=`    1/1    qr    kʷɚ
    ———————————————————————————

The wider the character, the longer the duration, the narrower and taller the character, the shorter the duration.

### Grooves

Grooves tell the duration of a bar. They are written between `|` characters with the number of holds like `|4.|` or `|....|`, both of which are identical and equivalent to the 4/4 time signature. However, one could specify 4/4 as `|4,|` or `|,,,,|` for upbeat numbers or `|4-|` or `|----|` for more languid tunes.

Here are four rather boring bars of Counternote:

    —————————————————————————————————————————
      # |4.|
      1
        | da=                             |
      2
        | da-             da-             |
      3
        | da.     da.     da.     da.     |
      4
        | da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, |
    —————————————————————————————————————————

You’ll notice that each of those notes takes up at least four spaces. There is a short cut that makes each note only take up three spaces and cuts down on visual noise. You’ll never guess what it’s called.

### Cuts

In Counternote, cuts are groups of notes that *cut* up some duration into equal parts. There are two kinds of cuts, long and short. It’s the short cuts that should be used most of the time. A triplet that takes up two beats in `|2.|` is notated like `| da.da.da |` with no spaces between the notes and the holds being added together. That works decently well for small prime numbers: duplets, triplets, quintuplets, but for quadruplets and sextuplets, duplets and triplets are connected with `'`:

    —————————————————————————————————————————————
      # |4.|
      1
        | da=                                 |
      2 # duplets
        | da-da             da-da             |
      3 # triplets
        | da.da.da          da.da.da          |
      4 # quadruplets
        | da.da'da.da       da.da'da.da       |
      5 # quintuplets
        | da,da,da,da,da    da,da,da,da,da    |
      6 # sextuplets
        | da,da,da'da,da,da da,da,da'da,da,da |
    —————————————————————————————————————————————

Notice how duplets can be used to simplify the bar:

    —————————————————————————————————————————
      # |4.|
      1 # like eight notes
        | da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, |
      2 # like quarter note duplets
        | da.da   da.da   da.da   da.da   |
    —————————————————————————————————————————

That is easier for the eye to parse and, as mentioned before, can save on horizontal space:

    ——————————————————————————————————
      # |4.|
      1 # space saving
        | da.da da.da da.da da.da  |
    ——————————————————————————————————

There are obviously other details to go over, but it’s time to see some real music. This is the A-section of the track Bourrée from Bach’s Lute Suite in E Minor written using tones:
