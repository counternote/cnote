# Quick Start

Counternote is a musical language, but do not let that idea trouble you if you failed Spanish. The way to learn Counternote is by practicing music, and practicing Counternote will help you learn music. If you are reading this, you are probably motivated to do one of those things, unlike Spanish class.

Sounds in Counternote come in three varieties — those where pitch is the defining characteristic, *tones* and *spans*, and those where pitch is, if determinable, are incidental, *raps*.

## Tones

First up to practice are the twelve *tones*. These refer to absolute pitch, each named uniquely. They’re kind of like the letter names, but more precise. Starting from a traditional E and ending on D♯/E♭, we have:

    ——————————————————————————————————————————————————
      E   F   F♯  G   G♯  A   A♯  B   C   C♯  D   D♯
      wa  ga  ka  ya  xa  ja  ca  za  da  fa  ba  pa
    ——————————————————————————————————————————————————

You’ll notice `ka` and `ca` and maybe `za` and `xa` seem like they might sound the same, but they don’t — `c` is a 'ch' sound and `x` is a 'sh' sound in Counternote, always.

With those two tweaks in mind, speak each tone aloud paying attention to where your tongue touches (or comes close to touching) the roof of your mouth all the way until `fa`, `ba`, and `pa` where you need to think about your lips. Now say `wa` again, this time thinking about your lips.

The tones in Counternote are ordered by points of articulation — which is just a fancy way of saying where the sound of a consonant is coming from — and come back around with `wa` which has two points of articulation: the lips and the back of the tongue. 

Now you are ready pick up a piano or sit at a guitar and in a range that is somewhat comfortable for your voice, play each note and sing the tone by its name. If you don’t yet know where the traditional notes are — look them up, it’s great practice. Try it singing the tones chromatically, then try just the naturals (white keys on the piano) or just the accidentals (black keys on the piano), maybe some major scales starting at different roots, some triads, whatever you like. Give it ten minutes at least, but no more than twenty.

### Starts and Rhymes

Maybe you’ll have noticed during that first exercise that while all of those tones start with different consonants, they all rhyme with `-a`. So that’s what it’s called, a *rhyme*. Might as well call the start of the tones the *start* while we are being Captain Obvious.

The tone starts tell you the “pitch class” which is music jargon for all the notes that we label a letter, like C. Not just middle C but any and all C. In Counternote, this is the *rank* of a sound.

The tone rhyme, on the other hand, tells which specific octave a note is in. For `-a`, it could be any octave, but more specifically it’s the center octave. `da` is likely to be middle C. `-e` will be an octave up from there; `-o`, an octave down. In Counternote, this is the *file* of a sound.

Tone starts and rhymes go rank and file.

There are eleven rhymes for eleven files but we only really care about seven:

    —————————————————————————————————

       -l     +3    ɛl     'el'
       -i     +2    i      'ee'
       -e     +1    e      'eh'
       -a      0    ɑ      'ah'
       -o     -1    o      'oh'
       -u     -2    u      'oo'
       -r     -3    ɚ      'er'
    —————————————————————————————————

In the key of `ja`, the note directly below `wa` is `po` and directly above `pa` is `we`. This is called the *break*. If we place the tones around a clockface with the key at 12, the break is bewteen 6 and 7:

    ——————————————————————————————————————————
                        12
              11        ja         1
                 xa  ===||===  ca
         10             ||              2
            ya  ========||========  za
                        ||
                        ||
      9   ka  ==========||==========  da   3
                        ||
                        ||
            ga  ========||========  fa
         8              ||              4
                 wa  ===||===  ba
              7         pa         5
             BREAK ↑    6
    ——————————————————————————————————————————

Now this may seem somewhat arbitrary — why not just always have the break between `wa` and `pa`? First of all, the break is informative, giving some sense of the range of a piece. But most importantly, it makes the tones and spans symmetrical.

Before we get to those spans, try taking out a piece of paper and drawing clockfaces, but instead of writing the numbers, place the tones in chromatic order. It’s okay if you are really bad at drawing circles, but it does help to place the tones right, so here’s a tip: put a mark at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions — north, east, south, west — and then put every third tone at those marks as you write them around the circle.

Hopefully that wasn’t so tedious that you never want to look at a clockface again, because this next section might just go all-in on clocks.

## Spans

While tones let us talk about pitch in an absolute way, spans let us talk about pitch in a relative way. Musicians train their relative pitch sensibilities more than anything else — the basis of which is interval training. A span is just the Counternote term for interval.

Instead of the academic names of minor third and major sixth, spans give a sense of interval by vowel quality. `ho` 'hoe' and `hm` 'home' are a minor third (♭3, m3) and a major sixth (6, M6). Notice that they share the same vowel 'oh'. That’s because a major sixth is the mirror version of a minor third and vice versa. A major sixth up is the same as a minor third down. A minor third up is the same as a major sixth down.

A great way of seeing these relationships is on the hue clock with intervals labeled in chromatic order (presented here with the English-ish pronunciation along the sides):

This time, starts and rhymes go file and rank, the inverse of the tones.
